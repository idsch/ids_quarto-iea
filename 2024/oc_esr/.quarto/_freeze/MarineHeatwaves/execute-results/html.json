MHWs are a growing field of study worldwide because of their effects on ecosystem structure, biodiversity, and regional economies.\n\n**Indicator Category**  &nbsp; &nbsp; Climate and Ocean Drivers\n \n**Data Steward**  &nbsp; &nbsp; Leising\n\n**Erddap Dataset ID**  &nbsp; &nbsp; cciea\\_OC\\_MHW, cciea\\_OC\\_MHW, cciea\\_OC\\_MHW\n\n\n**CCIEA timeseries ID**  &nbsp; &nbsp; cciea\\_OC\\_MHW\\_HC,  cciea\\_OC\\_MHW\\_MA, cciea\\_OC\\_MHW\\_MI\n\n**Region** &nbsp; &nbsp;  NA, NA, NA\n\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nThere is growing recognition that marine heatwaves can have strongly disruptive impacts on the CCE [@morgan2019recent].\nBased on an analysis of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) obtained from satellite measurements (OISST); we define marine heatwaves as 1.0 times when normalized SSTa \\>1.29 s.d. (90th percentile) of the long-term SSTa time series at a location, and 2. lasts for \\>5 days; which are analogous to the thresholds suggested in @hobday2016hierarchical. \nHere, we further report on statistics concerning large heatwaves (LHW) which were tracked through space and time, with LHW defined as those heatwaves with an area \\> 400,000 km2 (these denote the top 20% of all heatwaves by area as measured since 1982 when satellite data became available for tracking.\n\nThe underlying climatology used for SST anomaly analysis has changed from 1982-2010, to now encompass 1982-2020; hence small changes in the retrospective analysis of tracked heatwaves reported more recently as compared to previous reports.\n\n\n**Figures**\n\n::: {#fig-mhw_M}\n![](plots/oc_mhw_heatwave_cover_sum_area_intensity_Monthly.png){width=70%}\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n::: {#fig-mhw_S layout-ncol=3, layout=\"[50,-1,50,-1,50]\"  }\n\n![Heatwave Cover](plots/oc_mhw_heatwave_cover_Season.png){#fig-mhw_hc_S}\n\n![Sum Area](plots/oc_mhw_sum_area_Season.png){#fig-mhw_ma_S}\n\n![Intensity](plots/oc_mhw_intensity_Season.png){#fig-mhw_mi_S}\n\n\nSeasonal averages of the monthly MHW time series.\n:::\n\n**2024 Conditions**\n\n+ Monthly MHW sum area @fig-mhw_M was above the long-term mean during summer and fall 2024.\n+ Winter, Spring and Summer MHW sum area @fig-mhw_ma_S had 2024 values lower than 2023.\n+ Heat wave cover during the winter 2024 @fig-mhw_hc_S was above 1 sd, this probably can be attributed to El Ni√±o elevating coastal temperatures @fig-sst_spatial_winter.\n\n**References**\n",
