A positive ONI greater than 0.5°C indicates El Niño conditions, which usually means more storms to the south, weaker upwelling, and lower primary productivity in the CCLME. A negative ONI less than -0.5°C means La Niña conditions, which usually lead to higher productivity. \n\nThe PDO is related to sea surface temperature (SST), and is derived from sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) in the Northeast Pacific, which often persist in “regimes” that last for many years. In positive PDO regimes, coastal SSTa along North American tend to be warmer, while those in the central North Pacific tend to be cooler. Positive PDO values are associated with lower productivity in the CCLME. \n\nThe NPGO is a low-frequency variation of sea surface height, indicating variations in the circulation of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the Alaskan Gyre, which in turn relate to the source waters for the CCLME. Positive NPGO values are associated with increased equatorward flow, along with increased surface salinities, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a. Negative NPGO values are associated with decreases in such values, implying less subarctic source water and generally lower productivity. \n\nOceanic Niño Index information and data are from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center (<https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php>). \nPacific Decadal Oscillation data are from N. Mantua, NMFS/SWFSC, and are served on the CCIEA ERDDAP server (<https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cciea_OC_PDO.html>). \nNorth Pacific Gyre Oscillation data are from E. Di Lorenzo, Brown University (<https://www.o3d.org/npgo/index.html>).\n\n\n**Figures**\n\n::: {#fig-oni_pdo_npgo_M}\n![](plots/oc_ONI_PDO_NPGO_Monthly.png){width=70%}\n\nMonthly values of the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), starting 1950 and ending: October 2024 (ONI), November 2024 (PDO), and October 2024 (NPGO). \n\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n::: {#fig-oni_pdo_npgo_S layout-ncol=3, layout=\"[50,-1,50,-1,50]\"  }\n\n![ONI](plots/oc_ONI_Season.png){#fig-oni_S}\n\n![PDO](plots/oc_PDO_Season.png){#fig-pdo_S}\n\n![NPGO](plots/oc_NPGO_Season.png){#fig-npgo_S}\n\nSeasonal values of the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) from 1950-2024. \n\n:::\n\n**2024 Conditions**\n\n+ @fig-oni_pdo_npgo_M and @fig-oni_pdo_npgo_S show monthly and seasonal means of the three indices.\n+ El Niño event spanned the winter and spring 2023-24 and ENSO neutral by summer 2024 (@fig-oni_pdo_npgo_M and @fig-oni_S).\n+ Short duration La Niña conditions are expected by Jan 2024 (59% chance), with a quick transition to ENSO neutral by March-May 2024 (61% chance), see <https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/>.\n+ PDO and NPGO both have the 5-year mean below 1 standard deviation (@fig-oni_pdo_npgo_M), with the PDO having a negative 5-year trend.\n\n**References**\n",
