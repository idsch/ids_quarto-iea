The area of sea level pressure associated with the North Pacific High (NPH) can be used as an index of this winter preconditioning [@schroeder2013]. \n\n\n\n**Figures**\n\n::: {#fig-nph_jf}\n![](plots/oc_nph_jf_Annual.png){width=80%}\n\nArea of high atmospheric pressure of the North Pacific High averaged over January and February. \nThe area is the areal extent of the 1020 hPa isobar located in the eastern North Pacific [@schroeder2013].\nFNMOC six-hourly data used to find the area of the NPH is available at <https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/erdlasFnPres6>.\n:::\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n::: {#fig-nph_M}\n\n![](plots/oc_nph_Month.png){width=80%}\n\nMonthly values of the North Pacific High (NPH) area starting 1967 and ending: November 2024. \n\n:::\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-nph_S}\n\n![](plots/oc_nph_Season.png){width=40%}\n\nSeasonal values of the North Pacific High (NPH) area starting 1967 and ending 2024. \n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**2024 Conditions**\n\n+ The Jan-Feb NPH area was low during 2024, which is usual during an El Ni√±o @fig-nph_jf.\n+ With small Jan-Feb NPH area we would expect to see in central California coastal krill production down, lower rockfish growth, and delayed murre and auklet egg-laying dates [@schroeder2009]\n+ The Jan-Feb NPH area was large over 2020-23, resulting in negative 5-year trend due to the low 2024 value.\n\n**References**\n",
