The index describes the contraction and expansion of cool shelf habitat between the latitude range and from the coast out to 150 km offshore. Each month the area of water below a temperature threshold is calculated where a value of 0 represents no cool water in the region and a value of 1 indicates the whole area is comprised of cool water. Monthly resolved temperature thresholds are the spatial mean of temperature values between the latitude range and from the coast out to 75 km offshore over a climatological time period of 1980-2010.","key":"fig-mhw_S","order":{"number":1,"section":[5,0,0,0,0,0,0]}},{"caption":"Region 3 (35.5-40째N)","key":"fig-hci3_M","order":{"number":3},"parent":"fig-mhw_S"},{"caption":"Region 1 (43.5-48째N)","key":"fig-hci1_M","order":{"number":1},"parent":"fig-mhw_S"}],"headings":[],"options":{"chapters":true}}
