# SST anoms, 5-year means and trends

**Description** 
Seasonal SST summary maps are derived from the three statistics shown in the IEA type time series (current value, mean and trend over the last 5 years). 
The current value is shown as an anomaly and the 5-year mean and trend are 


**Indicator Category** Climate and Ocean Drivers
 
**Data Steward** Schroeder

**Erddap Dataset ID**

**CCIEA timeseries ID** 

**Region**


**Additional Information**
The seasonal averages are: winter (Jan-Mar), spring (Apr-Jun), summer (Jul-Sep), and summer (Oct-Nov).
Daily SST maps are optimally interpolated, remotely sensed temperatures [@Huang2021]. 
The daily optimal interpolated AVHRR SST can be downloaded from ERDDAP, https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html, dataset ID: ncdcOisst21Agg.

Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies (`{r} cciea_yr`; left), five-year means (2019–`{r} cciea_yr`; middle), and five-year trends (2019–`{r} cciea_yr`; right) in winter (Jan–Mar; top) and summer (Jul–Sep; bottom). 
The time series at each grid point began in 1982. 
Black circles mark cells where the anomaly was >1 SD above the long-term mean. Black x’s mark cells where the anomaly was the highest (or lowest) of the time series.

**Diagnositc maps with time series at key locations**

Understanding the anoms, 5-year means and trends can be difficult without looking at time series.
Below are diagnostic plots that have IEA time series at key locations on the maps.

**`{r} cciea_yr` Conditions**

+ Winter SST anomalies were positive (above 1°C) along the coast, the usual pattern for an El Niño winter @fig-sst_spatial_winter.
+ Summer SST anomalies were negative in the north and south (~1°C) and slightly above average (~0.5°C) in central California @fig-sst_spatial_summer.
+ Summer SST anomalies offshore were positve near the highest of the time series for the area centered on 45°N - 140°W @fig-sst_spatial_summer.
+ NOTE: Fall seasonal averages are not complete, they still need to be updated to include December.
