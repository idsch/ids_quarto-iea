# Habitat Compression Index

```
**Description** The Habitat Compression Index (HCI) is the area of cool habitat along the coast, which is suitable for a diverse and productive portion of the CCE food web. HCI is estimated in four biogeographic provinces along the shelf within the CCE.

**Metafile name** `{r} fn_meta`
 
**Indicator Category** `{r} vec2[['Component_Section']]`
 
**Data Steward** `{r} vec2[['PI']]`

**Erddap Dataset ID** `{r} ds_id`

**CCIEA timeseries ID** `{r} ds_id_lbl`

**Region** `{r} rgn_lbl`


**Public availability statement** Source data are publicly available.

**Data sources** Surface temperature data are the 2 m temperature levels of the University of California Santa Cruz 31-year historical reanalysis (<https://oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu/reanalccs31/>) and near-real-time (NRT; <https://oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu/ccsnrt/>) data-assimilative models.


**Additional Information**
The HCI is defined over 4 regions along the coast (43.5-48°N, 40-43.5°N, 35.5-40°N, and 30-35.5°N).
The HCI is calculated the same for each region and is defined as the area of cool monthly averaged sea temperatures at a depth of 2 m that fall below a temperature threshold, in a region extending from the coast to 150 km offshore between the latitude ranges of the 4 regions.
Each month has a unique temperature threshold that is defined as the spatial average of all 2 m temperatures from the coast to 75 km offshore in the latitudinal region for a given month over a climatological period of 1980 to 2010 [@santora2020habitat, @schroeder2022].

Monthly habitat compression index (HCI) for January 1980 to November (`{r} cciea_yr`). 
The index describes the contraction and expansion of cool shelf habitat between the latitude range and from the coast out to 150 km offshore. 
Each month the area of water below a temperature threshold is calculated where a value of 0 represents no cool water in the region and a value of 1 indicates the whole area is comprised of cool water. 
Monthly resolved temperature thresholds are the spatial mean of temperature values between the latitude range and from the coast out to 75 km offshore over a climatological time period of 1980-2010.

**`{r} cciea_yr` Conditions**

+ For regions 1-3, the HCI during Winter 2024 (@fig-hci_M, @fig-hci_S) was zero due to the  2023-24 El Niño influence on the CCS (@fig-oni_S).
+ The influence of 2023-24 El Niño was not as great for the HCI in region 4 (@fig-hci4_S).
+ Spring 2024 HCI values average (@fig-hci_S).
