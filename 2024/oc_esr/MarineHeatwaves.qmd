# Marine Heatwaves

**Description** 
Marine heatwaves (MHW) occur when ocean temperatures are much warmer than usual for an extended period of time; they are specifically defined by the difference between the current temperature and the expected temperature for a specific location and time of year [1]. MHWs are a growing field of study worldwide because of their effects on ecosystem structure, biodiversity, and regional economies.

**Additional Information**

There is growing recognition that marine heatwaves can have strongly disruptive impacts on the CCE [@morgan2019recent].
Based on an analysis of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) obtained from satellite measurements (OISST); we define marine heatwaves as 1.0 times when normalized SSTa \>1.29 s.d. (90th percentile) of the long-term SSTa time series at a location, and 2. lasts for \>5 days; which are analogous to the thresholds suggested in @hobday2016hierarchical. 
Here, we further report on statistics concerning large heatwaves (LHW) which were tracked through space and time, with LHW defined as those heatwaves with an area \> 400,000 km2 (these denote the top 20% of all heatwaves by area as measured since 1982 when satellite data became available for tracking.

The underlying climatology used for SST anomaly analysis has changed from 1982-2010, to now encompass 1982-2020; hence small changes in the retrospective analysis of tracked heatwaves reported more recently as compared to previous reports.

**`{r} cciea_yr` Conditions**

+ Monthly MHW sum area @fig-mhw_M was above the long-term mean during summer and fall 2024.
+ Winter, Spring and Summer MHW sum area @fig-mhw_ma_S had 2024 values lower than 2023.
+ Heat wave cover during the winter 2024 @fig-mhw_hc_S was above 1 sd, this probably can be attributed to El Ni√±o elevating coastal temperatures @fig-sst_spatial_winter.
