Large-scale variability is represented by three indices: the status of the equatorial El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), described by the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI, https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php); the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, Mantua et al. 1997); and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO, Di Lorenzo et al. 2008). Positive ONI and PDO values and negative NPGO values usually denote conditions that lead to low CCLME productivity, whereas negative ONI and PDO values and positive NPGO values are associated with periods of high CCE productivity.\nIndicator Category     Climate and Ocean Drivers\nData Steward     Schroeder\nErddap Dataset ID     cciea_OC_ONI, cciea_OC_PDO, cciea_OC_NPGO\nCCIEA timeseries ID     cciea_OC_ONI, cciea_OC_PDO, cciea_OC_NPGO\nRegion     NA, NA, NA\nAdditional Information\nENSO events impact the CCLME by modifying the jet stream and storm tracks, changing the nearshore thermocline, and influencing coastal currents that affect poleward transport and distribution of equatorial and subequatorial waters (and species). A positive ONI greater than 0.5°C indicates El Niño conditions, which usually means more storms to the south, weaker upwelling, and lower primary productivity in the CCLME. A negative ONI less than -0.5°C means La Niña conditions, which usually lead to higher productivity.\nThe PDO is related to sea surface temperature (SST), and is derived from sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) in the Northeast Pacific, which often persist in “regimes” that last for many years. In positive PDO regimes, coastal SSTa along North American tend to be warmer, while those in the central North Pacific tend to be cooler. Positive PDO values are associated with lower productivity in the CCLME.\nThe NPGO is a low-frequency variation of sea surface height, indicating variations in the circulation of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the Alaskan Gyre, which in turn relate to the source waters for the CCLME. Positive NPGO values are associated with increased equatorward flow, along with increased surface salinities, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a. Negative NPGO values are associated with decreases in such values, implying less subarctic source water and generally lower productivity.\nOceanic Niño Index information and data are from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center (https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php). Pacific Decadal Oscillation data are from N. Mantua, NMFS/SWFSC, and are served on the CCIEA ERDDAP server (https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cciea_OC_PDO.html).

FNMOC produces operational forecasts of the state of the atmosphere and the ocean several times daily and maintains archives of several important parameters, such as sea level pressure and temperature. The NPH area is derived from FNMOC Sea Level Pressure (SLP) monthly means. The SLP data are available at https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/erdlasFnWPr.html.\nAdditional Information   &nbsp During the winter, periods of upwelling or, farther north, reduced downwelling can limit stratification and facilitate introduction of nutrients to the surface, acting to precondition the ecosystem for increased production in the spring (Schroeder et al. 2009; Black et al. 2010). The area of sea level pressure associated with the North Pacific High (NPH) can be used as an index of this winter preconditioning (Schroeder et al. 2013).\nFigures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Area of high atmospheric pressure of the North Pacific High averaged over January and February.

Based on an analysis of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) obtained from satellite measurements (OISST); we define marine heatwaves as 1.0 times when normalized SSTa &gt;1.29 s.d. (90th percentile) of the long-term SSTa time series at a location, and 2. lasts for &gt;5 days; which are analogous to the thresholds suggested in Hobday et al. (2016). Here, we further report on statistics concerning large heatwaves (LHW) which were tracked through space and time, with LHW defined as those heatwaves with an area &gt; 400,000 km2 (these denote the top 20% of all heatwaves by area as measured since 1982 when satellite data became available for tracking.\nThe underlying climatology used for SST anomaly analysis has changed from 1982-2010, to now encompass 1982-2020; hence small changes in the retrospective analysis of tracked heatwaves reported more recently as compared to previous reports.\nFigures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Heatwave Cover\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Sum Area\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Intensity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Seasonal averages of the monthly MHW time series.\n\n\n\n2024 Conditions\n\nMonthly MHW sum area Figure 4.1 was above the long-term mean during summer and fall 2024.\nWinter, Spring and Summer MHW sum area Figure 4.2 (b) had 2024 values lower than 2023.\nHeat wave cover during the winter 2024 Figure 4.2 (a) was above 1 sd, this probably can be attributed to El Niño elevating coastal temperatures Figure 3.2 (a).\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nHobday, Alistair J, Lisa V Alexander, Sarah E Perkins, Dan A Smale, Sandra C Straub, Eric CJ Oliver, Jessica A Benthuysen, et al. 2016. “A Hierarchical Approach to Defining Marine Heatwaves.” Progress in Oceanography 141: 227–38.\n\n\nMorgan, Cheryl A, Brian R Beckman, Laurie A Weitkamp, and Kurt L Fresh. 2019. “Recent Ecosystem Disturbance in the Northern California Current.” Fisheries 44 (10): 465–74.",

The NH25 (top plot) temperature anomalies are monthly means and the time interval is one month (i.e., 12 values per year). The CalCOFI (bottom plot) temperature anomalies are quarterly means and the time intervals are seasons (i.e., four values per year). Months or quarters not sampled are marked with a black circle along the top axis; missing samples are filled using bi-linear interpolation. Sampling missed due to Covid restrictions are marked with a black triangle. The spring 2020 and winter 2022 CalCOFI temperature profiles were filled using daily mean temperature data on April 15, 2020 and January 31, 2022 from a data assimilative ocean model (NRT ROMS; https://oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu/ccsnrt/).\n\n\n\n2024 Conditions\n\nAt NH25 influence of the winter 2023-2024 El Niño has greatest subsurface extent in Jan 2024 Figure 6.1.\nNH25 temperature anomalies over 0-50 m not as high as previous El Niño events in 1998 and 2016.\nTemperature anomalies at station CalCOFI 93-30 over 0-200 m not as high as previous El Niño events in 1998 and 2016.",

Upwelling, driven by equatorward-blowing winds, is a physical process of lifting cold, nutrient- rich water from deep in the ocean to the surface. Upwelling fuels the high seasonal primary production at the base of the CCE food web. The timing, strength, and duration of upwelling vary greatly along the coast.\nMetafile name /home/isaac/Work/IEA/2024/tech_document/CCIEA_metadata_2024-09-26.xlsx\nIndicator Category Climate and Ocean Drivers\nData Steward Schroeder\nErddap Dataset ID cciea_OC_CUTI, cciea_OC_BEUTI\nCCIEA timeseries ID\nRegion NA (45.0N, NAW), NA (39.0N, NAW), NA (33.0N, NAW), NA (45.0N, NAW), NA (39.0N, NAW), NA (33.0N, NAW)\nPublic availability statement Source data are publicly available.\nData sources CUTI and BEUTI are updated with data from the near-real-time (NRT; https://oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu/ccsnrt/) data-assimilative models.\nBakun UI is derived from geostrophic estimates fro winds derived from FNMOC sealevel pressure estimates.\nAdditional Information Estimates of coastal upwelling, specifically the vertical water volume transport (Coastal Upwelling Transport Index; CUTI) and the vertical nitrate flux (Biologically Effective Upwelling Transport Index; BEUTI). We now use these indices to describe upwelling in the CCE reports, as they better represent surface winds, ocean circulation, and subsurface variability. CUTI provides more accurate estimates of vertical transport of water. BEUTI provides additional information about the nature of the upwelled water (e.g., its nitrate content) that can be linked to ecological processes such as productivity Jacox et al. (2018).\nDaily values of CUTI and BEUTI are derived from numerical model outputs described in Jacox et al. (2018).
