Large-scale variability is represented by three indices: the status of the equatorial El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), described by the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI, https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php); the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, Mantua et al. 1997); and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO, Di Lorenzo et al. 2008). Positive ONI and PDO values and negative NPGO values usually denote conditions that lead to low CCLME productivity, whereas negative ONI and PDO values and positive NPGO values are associated with periods of high CCE productivity.\nIndicator Category     Climate and Ocean Drivers\nData Steward     Schroeder\nErddap Dataset ID     cciea_OC_ONI, cciea_OC_PDO, cciea_OC_NPGO\nCCIEA timeseries ID     cciea_OC_ONI, cciea_OC_PDO, cciea_OC_NPGO\nRegion     NA, NA, NA\nAdditional Information\nENSO events impact the CCLME by modifying the jet stream and storm tracks, changing the nearshore thermocline, and influencing coastal currents that affect poleward transport and distribution of equatorial and subequatorial waters (and species). A positive ONI greater than 0.5°C indicates El Niño conditions, which usually means more storms to the south, weaker upwelling, and lower primary productivity in the CCLME. A negative ONI less than -0.5°C means La Niña conditions, which usually lead to higher productivity.\nThe PDO is related to sea surface temperature (SST), and is derived from sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) in the Northeast Pacific, which often persist in “regimes” that last for many years. In positive PDO regimes, coastal SSTa along North American tend to be warmer, while those in the central North Pacific tend to be cooler. Positive PDO values are associated with lower productivity in the CCLME.\nThe NPGO is a low-frequency variation of sea surface height, indicating variations in the circulation of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the Alaskan Gyre, which in turn relate to the source waters for the CCLME. Positive NPGO values are associated with increased equatorward flow, along with increased surface salinities, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a. Negative NPGO values are associated with decreases in such values, implying less subarctic source water and generally lower productivity.\nOceanic Niño Index information and data are from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center (https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php). Pacific Decadal Oscillation data are from N. Mantua, NMFS/SWFSC, and are served on the CCIEA ERDDAP server (https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cciea_OC_PDO.html). North Pacific Gyre Oscillation data are from E.

The area of sea level pressure associated with the North Pacific High (NPH) can be used as an index of this winter preconditioning (Schroeder et al. 2013).\nFigures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Area of high atmospheric pressure of the North Pacific High averaged over January and February.

Based on an analysis of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) obtained from satellite measurements (OISST); we define marine heatwaves as 1.0 times when normalized SSTa &gt;1.29 s.d. (90th percentile) of the long-term SSTa time series at a location, and 2. lasts for &gt;5 days; which are analogous to the thresholds suggested in Hobday et al. (2016). Here, we further report on statistics concerning large heatwaves (LHW) which were tracked through space and time, with LHW defined as those heatwaves with an area &gt; 400,000 km2 (these denote the top 20% of all heatwaves by area as measured since 1982 when satellite data became available for tracking; Leising, in revision).\nThe underlying climatology used for SST anomaly analysis has changed from 1982-2010, to now encompass 1982-2020; hence small changes in the retrospective analysis of tracked heatwaves reported more recently as compared to previous reports.\nFigures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Heatwave Cover\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Sum Area\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Intensity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2\n\n\n\n2024 Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences",
